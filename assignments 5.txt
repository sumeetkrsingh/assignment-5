Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the script does:
space_free=$( df -h | awk '{ print $5 }' | sort -n | tail -n 1 | sed 's/%//' ):
This line uses the df command to display information about the file system usage on the machine, with the -h option to display the output in human-readable format.
The output of df is piped | to awk, which selects the fifth column (the percentage of disk space used) from each line of the output.
The output of awk is piped to sort, which sorts the percentages in numerical order (-n option).
The output of sort is piped to tail, which selects the last line (i.e., the line with the highest percentage of disk space used).
The output of tail is piped to sed, which removes the percent sign from the percentage.
The resulting value is stored in the space_free variable.
case $space_free in:
This starts a case statement that checks the value of the space_free variable.


[1-5]*) echo Plenty of disk space available.
This case branch matches any value between 1 and 5 (inclusive) followed by any character (*).
If the value matches this pattern, the script prints the message "Plenty of disk space available" and exits the case statement.

[6-7]*) echo There could be a problem in the near future.
This case branch matches any value between 6 and 7 (inclusive) followed by any character (*).
If the value matches this pattern, the script prints the message "There could be a problem in the near future" and exits the case statement.

8*) echo Maybe we should look at clearing out old files.
This case branch matches any value starting with 8.
If the value matches this pattern, the script prints the message "Maybe we should look at clearing out old files" and exits the case statement.

9*) echo We could have a serious problem on our hands soon.
This case branch matches any value starting with 9.
If the value matches this pattern, the script prints the message "We could have a serious problem on our hands soon" and exits the case statement.

*) echo Something is not quite right here.
This case branch matches any value that does not match the previous patterns.
If the value matches this pattern, the script prints the message "Something is not quite right here" and exits the case statement.
The overall effect of the script is to print a message based on the amount of disk space currently available on the system, with more urgent messages printed for higher percentages of disk space usage.
